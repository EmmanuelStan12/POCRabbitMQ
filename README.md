# RabbitMQ Concepts for POC (Spring Java)
This document outlines some key concepts in RabbitMQ relevant to our Proof-of-Concept (POC) project built with Spring Java. Here, we'll discuss RabbitMQ fundamentals and how they apply to our single-application server-client setup.

## What is RabbitMQ?

RabbitMQ is a lightweight, open-source message broker that enables asynchronous communication between applications. It acts as a central hub for exchanging messages, allowing applications to decouple message production and consumption.
RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker software written in Erlang. It is commonly called a message-oriented middleware that implements the AMQP. It is an open source message broker service that implements the Advanced message queueing protocol (AMQP). It acts as a middleware or central hub for services or applications to exchange information or messages asynchronously.

## Key Concepts:

- Message Broker: RabbitMQ acts as a broker for messages from producers that send these messages to the broker service and other services (consumers) listen for these messages. Thus it manages the delivery of messages from the producer to the consumer and also ensures reliability and ordered delivery of messages from producer to consumer(s) even if either parties are unavailable.

- Asynchronous Communication: RabbitMQ enables async communication between applications. This means that the producer doesn't need to wait till the consumer is ready, it can simply send the messages to the broker service and the receiver can retrieve it later. This promotes decoupling between applications and also scalability.

## Core components:

- Producers: Applications that send messages to RabbitMQ.
- Messages: These are pieces of information being sent from the producer to the exchange or broker service.
- Consumers: Applications that receive messages from RabbitMQ.
- Queues: Temporary buffers that hold messages until a consumer retrieves them. Messages are processed in the order they are received (FIFO).
- Exchanges: Routing mechanisms that determine how messages are delivered to queues. They can be specific rules or patterns. They receive messages from producers and route them using the routing rules defined in the bindings and routes them to the queue for the consumer.
- Bindings: Connections between exchanges and queues that define how messages are routed. A binding is a link between an exchange and a queue that defines the routing rules for messages, it specifies how messages should be routed from the exchange to the queue.
- Broker: This is basically the RabbitMQ service itself that consists of the exchange for routing mechanisms and the queues the temporary buffers for messages. It basically the intermediary software for facilitating communication between different applications by receiving, storing and routing messages.
- Routing key: This is a value attached to a message by the producer. It is used by the exchange to determine the queue to route the message to.
- Connection: This represents a communication link between a client app and a RabbitMQ broker. It is established when a client app connects to the broker and allows the client to receive and/or send messages.
- Binding key: This is the binding criteria used in RabbitMQ to determine the messages should be routed from an exchange to a particular queue. The message is received from the producer and the binding key is compared with the routing key in the message before the message is routed to the appropriate queue.

## Our POC Setup:

Since our project utilizes a single Spring application for both server and client functionality, we'll likely leverage a Topic Exchange for point-to-point communication. The application will act as both a producer (publishing messages) and a consumer (receiving messages).

## Benefits of RabbitMQ in POC:

- Decoupling: Sender and receiver are loosely coupled, allowing independent development and deployment.
Scalability: Message handling scales by adding more consumers or producers as needed.
- Asynchronous Communication: Improves application responsiveness by processing messages asynchronously.
Reliability: RabbitMQ offers features like message persistence and retries for reliable delivery.
Next Steps:

## Explore Spring AMQP functionalities for integrating RabbitMQ messaging into our application.
- Define specific message formats and exchange/queue configurations based on our POC requirements.
- Implement message publishing and consumption logic within the Spring application.
